//! Kernel-side scaffolding: virtual address space, thunk allocator,
//! thread state, scheduling.
//!
//! In PocketHLE every emulated process owns a single 32-bit address
//! space. The kernel is responsible for:
//!
//! * Mapping the loaded PE image into the CPU.
//! * Allocating a contiguous "thunk" region — one 4-byte slot per
//!   imported symbol — and patching the IAT so that calls into a
//!   foreign DLL transfer control to a known address that the CPU
//!   has marked with a code hook. When the hook fires, the host
//!   dispatches the call through [`Dispatcher`].
//! * Maintaining a stack and minimal heap for the emulated thread.
//!
//! The kernel does **not** implement individual API functions — that
//! is the responsibility of `pocket-winceapi`. Instead, the kernel
//! exposes a [`Dispatcher`] trait that an API layer registers itself
//! against.
